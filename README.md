# Mobile-Price-Prediction
Predicting the price of a mobile phone, given its statistics, using ML algorithms

In this project, emphasis was given on data analysis, performing EDA, to better grasp the correlations between the features, and then applying algorithms usch as gradient boosting and random forest, to perform predictions for a given mobile phone, after training our data.
